        The Graphic Era Educational Society (GEES), established in 1993, is a non-profit organization that aims to mobilize world-class education and generate resources for providing and supporting quality education for all. The society recognizes the right of every individual to lead a life of dignity and self-respect in a just and equitable manner. Initially, Graphic Era Educational Society inaugurated its operations as Graphic Era Institute of Technology, which achieved the distinction of being the first self- financed educational institute in North India, offering engineering courses. The Institute was the culmination of the dream of its visionary founder, Prof. (Dr) Kamal Ghanshala, to change the destiny of thousands of youth by providing an excellent and holistic professional education. He had visualized an educational hub that would cater to the academic aspirations of innumerable young men and women and his vision took a concrete shape in the form of Graphic Era Institute.
